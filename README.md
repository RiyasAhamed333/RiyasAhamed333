🚀 Projects

🔹 AWS 3-Tier Architecture Deployment (High Availability + Security)

Built a scalable and secure 3-tier cloud architecture on AWS with dedicated Web, App, and DB layers. Implemented Application Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Groups for high availability. Configured RDS Multi-AZ for automatic failover, S3 + CloudFront for global content delivery, and Route 53 for DNS routing. Deployed all resources inside a secure VPC with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway, and strict security groups. Automated server setup and deployments using Bash scripting.

Skills: AWS · EC2 · VPC · Route 53 · CloudFront · Auto Scaling · Bash

🔹 Automated CI/CD Pipeline – Jenkins, GitHub Webhooks, AWS EC2

Designed and implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins with GitHub Webhooks to trigger builds on every code commit. Configured build → test → deploy stages and deployed applications to AWS EC2 over secure SSH. Integrated Docker for consistent build environments, implemented rollback support, automated testing, and added pipeline notifications. Improved deployment reliability and significantly reduced manual work.

Skills: Jenkins · Docker · GitHub · AWS EC2 · CI/CD Pipelines · Linux

🔹 Monitoring & Observability – Prometheus & Grafana

Implemented a full observability stack using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for dashboards. Installed and configured Node Exporters to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network performance. Built multiple visual dashboards, configured alert rules, and integrated CloudWatch metrics from AWS EC2. Ensured proper metric retention, alerts on threshold breaches, and proactive monitoring.

Skills: Prometheus · Grafana · Linux · Monitoring & Logging · Alerting · Amazon CloudWatch

🔹 Serverless CSV Pipeline – S3 → Lambda → DynamoDB

Developed a fully serverless and automated CSV ingestion pipeline. When a CSV file is uploaded to S3, it triggers a Lambda function that parses the file and performs batch insert/update/delete operations in DynamoDB. Designed for real industry use cases like Flipkart product price updates, inventory sync, and bulk data processing. Includes error handling, CloudWatch logging, and data normalization for high-volume workloads.

Skills: AWS Lambda · Amazon S3 · DynamoDB · Python · Serverless Architecture · IAM · CloudWatch
